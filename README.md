<h2> Motivation </h2>

<p> Offshore wind energy is an essential tool in meeting the EUs net 100% green energy goal as outlined by the European Green Deal. It requires about 450 GW of offshore wind to meet its goals by 2050. The technology involved in adapting onshore wind turbines for offshore wind is more then 30 years old, with the first offshore wind plant erected in Denmark in 1991.
